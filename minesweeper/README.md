# Minesweeper Game

Welcome to my Minesweeper game implemented in Python! This project serves as a practical exercise to enhance my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) skills. The game is designed to challenge strategic thinking and pattern recognition, requiring players to navigate through a minefield without detonating any mines.

## Features
- **Object-Oriented Design:** The game utilizes OOP principles to ensure a modular and maintainable codebase.
- **Unit Tests:** Comprehensive unit tests have been included to verify the correctness of implemented functionalities.
- **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):** The project incorporates ORM for efficient data management, facilitating interaction with a database.

## How to Play
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. run main.py

# Note:
The game currently requires input as expected to function correctly.
